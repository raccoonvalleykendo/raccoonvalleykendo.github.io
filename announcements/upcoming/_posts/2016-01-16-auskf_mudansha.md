##AUSKF Adult/Mudansha Kendo Seminar

Dear AUSKF Kenshi:

It is with great excitement that the AUSKF Education Committee announces the first ever AUSKF Adult / Mudansha Kendo Seminar, to be held on January 16-17, 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

This Seminar will provide tailored instruction and guidance to AUSKF kenshi that first started kendo as an adult (18+ years). Current kyu kenshi as well as yudansha who started kendo as an adult are welcome to participate. Participants will be divided into similar age/rank groups so that instructors can provide personalized instruction and also act as a mentor to adult kenshi. But most importantly, this Seminar is aimed to provide motivation and support for a very important group within our AUSKF kenshi population.

We are charging a participant fee of $50 per person, which will include lunch for both days of the Seminar. Other transportation and other expenses must be borne by each participant. We are expecting a very large turnout so please register as soon as possible using the following link: REGISTRATION PAGE

Official hotel information, goodwill party information and other details will be provided shortly to registered participants and on our website! We look forward to seeing as many of you as possible in Las Vegas!

Regards,

Chris Yang

AUSKF VP of Education
