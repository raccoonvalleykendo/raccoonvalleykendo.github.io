## Please register with the AUSKF and MWKF

Hello MWKF Dojo Representatives,

It is that time of the year again! Please encourage your dojo members to apply for their 2016-2017 AUSKF/MWKF Memberships.
The benefits include liability insurance, eligibility for promotion, participation in regional and national events,
and a discount for participating in regional tournaments.  There have been unfortunate incidents where those who wanted to
participate in these events were unable to do so because they failed to complete the proper paperwork.
We process applications three times a year:

>at the beginning of the year (this time),<br>
>at the summer camp,<br>
>and at the fall MWKF tournament.<br>

It is easier for everybody if he/she takes care of their membership now.

In 2015, the AUSKF changed its membership cycle start date from January to April.
2015 memberships will continue to be valid until 3/31/2016.  Renewing your memberships now will extend them through March 2017.
However, because of the changed membership period, there are also some changes to how registrations are being handled.
Please have your members review the following information carefully:

1.  2015 Late Registrations - if your dojo member has not registered for the 2015-2016 membership period and wants to participate in promotion,
taikai, or other events requiring a current AUSKF ID that take place prior to April 1 of this year,
(such as Detroit Taikai), they will need to register for 2015-2016.  The fee will not be prorated and will not be
applied towards the cost of the 2016-2017 membership.  Club members can apply for the remainder of
the 2015-16 cycle by following this link:  [2015-16 AUSKF/MWKF Membership Application](https://form.jotform.com/52613814253956)

2.  2016 Open Registration - All members should register no later than
**March 11, 2016**.  Applications received after this deadline will not be processed until the next enrollment period (around the Summer Camp).
Registration can be completed by following this link:  [2016-17 AUSKF/MWKF Membership Application](https://form.jotform.com/60044988552967)


3.  Payment - As was the case last year, the registration forms are linked to Paypal.
Once your members fill out the membership form, they will be redirected to Paypal for payment.
Paypal will give a total amount owed.  Members can use a Paypal account OR a credit card.
If a user does not want to use Paypal or a credit card they can hit cancel at the bottom of the page and their form will still be submitted.
Members do NOT have to have a Paypal account to use this payment method.

 Members will receive an email confirmation of their form submission.  Once each dojo's members have filled out their forms,
 the MWKF treasurer (Mr. Lee) will send the dojo representative an invoice for the remaining 2015 dues for people who did not pay
 electronically and will also send their representative dojo MWKF roster.  Please encourage people to pay by credit card or paypal
 since it will make less administrative work for you.  Each dojo representative should verify the roster information for their dojo.
 Dojo representatives will NOT need to fill out any spreadsheets or collect member info.  They will only be responsible for making sure
 all of their dojo's members fill out the forms before the appropriate deadlines.

###All members are strongly encouraged to complete the registration process as soon as possible.

 Thank you all. I wish you all the very best and a successful 2016.

  Best regards,
  Chris Thompson
  MWKF Secretary
