On behalf of Yuka Saathoff, MWKF President, I am happy to announce that we will have MWKF Summer camp in **Madison, WI** on **7/29-7/31**. It is a little earlier than the previous years. Please save the date. More information to follow.

Again we will have Yamanaka sensei, Hanshi 8 dan and Saito sensei, Kyoshi 8 dan visiting from Saitama Japan.

Best regards,
